iot-based water quality monitoring system
developed an lot-based system for real-time water quality monitoring:
integrated arduino uno with esp8266 wi-fi module, ph, turbidity, tds, and temperature
sensors for comprehensive water analysis.
enabled cloud integration via apis to store and update water quality data for remote
monitoring and analysis.
locking system using relay
a 4x4 keypad is used to enter a password, with each
press sending a unique signal to the
microcontroller.
the microcontroller (arduino) reads the
signals and checks if the entered password
matches a pre-programmed one.
if the password is correct, the microcontroller triggers a

unlocking it:
smart dustbin using arduino
an ultrasonic sensor was used t0 measure the fill level of the dustbin by detecting the distance
to the garbage:
integrated this with an arduino with a wifi sensor that processes sensor data and sends it to a
server via wi-fi.
processes sensor data and sends it to a server via wi-fi, which alerts the systems about the
